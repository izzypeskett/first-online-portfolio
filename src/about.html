        <h1>Hey, I'm Izzy Peskett.</h1>
        <p>I'm a junior software developer with a keen interest in UX, emerging technology and the ever growing and intertwining relationship between humans and tech.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about" id="story">
        <h1>In 25 words or less..</h1>
        <p>I began my journey as an elite athlete. One thing was on my mind playing hockey for Australia. Unfortunately we can't all play for our country. So I did the next best thing and studied sport science. The creative child inside me was having quite a spat. I changed tact, to nutrition. With a Bachelor of Nutrition under my belt I set out to make my own mushroom coffee blend. Being a conscious millenial I ensured best practice for sustainability by sourcing 100% decompostable packaging for the mushroom coffee. Click here for a look, maybe even a buy.</p>
        <p>As much as I love all things health, environment and start-ups. I was after more. Cue software development.</p>
        <p>I am currently over half way through Coder Academy's Fast Track bootcamp and come early February I will be a Full Stack Developer.</p>
        <p>25 words, close enough.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about" id="work">
        <h1>What excites me?</h1>
        <p>Single origin long blacks and homemade nachos.</p>
        <p>Work that is purpose driven and has humans at the centre. I get invigorated by working in a team environment, stimulated by challenging projects and motivated by the desire to continue to learn and improve. And yes I am a big fan of agile methodology. I am fascinated with how users experience not only technology and applications but life. A question I ponder is how can I make their day, week and life better. What experience can I provide?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about" id="approach">
        <h1>A wise human once said...</h1>
        <p><em>Two roads diverged in the woods, and I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference.</em></p>
        <p>That human was Robert Frost.</p>
        <p>And those words sum up how I approach not only my work but my life. I don't like to take the easy or the typical route. I like to extend the seams and explore the more, because I find the reward is so much greater.</p>
        <p>My strengths lie in problem solving, algorithmic thinking, designing for humans and ideating new concepts.</p>
        <p>On a technical level the stack, languages and frameworks I have worked with include Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, SASS, POSTGRESQL, AWS, Vanilla Javascript and Node.JS. By the end of February I will have knowledge and worked with the MERN stack, including React. I have used Github, Trello and wireframing software like Figma. </p>
