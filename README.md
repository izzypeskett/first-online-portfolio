## Description
### Purpose
To build an online portfolio using HTML5 and CSS for potential employers.
The portfolio had to include
- 5 linked html pages
- html semantics 
- the use of either CSS grid, flex-box or combination of both
- portfolio must be responsive
### Functionality
My online portfolio needed to reflect not only my technical skills but also convery who I am. 
I was inspired by the minimalist aesthetic and the city of Melbourne. 
**Typography:** Imported from Google fonts
1. Poppins, sans-serif
2. Anonymous Pro, monospace 
**Colour-scheme** I chose four colours for my portfolio
Primary - Midnight Express, HEX #282B3A
Primary accent - Coral, HEX #FE7F52
Secondary - Quartz, HEX #D7D6DE
Secondary second - Whisper #EBEBEB
#### Features
- CSS Grid for ease of placement of content and responsiveness .
- CSS animations including hover, fade in and transform for mobile responsiveness and allows a clean aesthetic for each page. It also allows the user to feel more engaged and provides interaction points. 
- Footer that is fixed to the bottom of the page and contains social media links.
- Navigation bar that highlights the active html page.
